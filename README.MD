RENDER GRAPH

Here are some fundamental and commonly used RenderPasses that are typically implemented in a game:

Geometry Pass:
Responsible for rendering the geometry of the scene. It includes tasks such as vertex shading, fragment shading, and writing to depth and G-buffer (geometry buffer) for further processing.

Shadow Pass:
Generates shadow maps by rendering the scene from the light's perspective to compute shadows accurately in the subsequent passes.

Lighting Pass:
Computes lighting contributions, including diffuse, specular, ambient, etc., based on the G-buffer information and any shadow maps generated in the shadow pass.

Post-Processing Passes:
These passes apply post-processing effects to the rendered image, such as bloom, blur, tonemapping, and color grading, to enhance the visual quality of the scene.

Transparency Pass:
Handles rendering transparent objects, which require special treatment for correct blending and ordering based on the camera's view.

UI Pass:
Renders user interface (UI) elements and heads-up display (HUD) on top of the 3D scene, typically in screen-space or using an orthographic projection.

Skybox Pass:
Renders the sky or environment background, providing a backdrop to the scene. It's often done as a separate pass for efficiency.

Particle Pass:
Renders particles or other special effects like fire, smoke, etc., using techniques optimized for rendering numerous small elements.

Resolve Pass:
Resolves the final image for presentation, handling any necessary color space conversions or final blending.

UI Pass:
Renders UI elements and HUD on top of the 3D scene, usually in screen space or using an orthographic projection.

Custom Effects Passes:
Depending on the game's requirements, custom passes may be added for specific effects or rendering tasks unique to the game, such as water rendering, reflections, etc.

Each RenderPass is responsible for specific rendering tasks and contributes to the final image. By organizing rendering tasks into these passes within a RenderGraph, the rendering process becomes modular, efficient, and easier to manage, especially in complex game rendering pipelines. The exact composition and design of the RenderGraph, including the number and order of passes, will vary based on the game's needs and desired visual effects.


CHAINING RENDER PASSES

Chaining multiple render passes to build one image involves defining a rendering pipeline in which each render pass contributes to the final image. This is a common technique used in modern graphics programming to achieve complex rendering effects and efficiently process a scene. Here are the steps to chain multiple render passes to build a final image:

Define Render Passes:
Identify the individual rendering tasks or stages that contribute to building the final image. Each of these tasks will be encapsulated within a separate render pass.

Create a Render Pass for Each Stage:
Define a render pass for each rendering stage, specifying the necessary inputs, outputs, and operations (such as clear operations or load/store operations) for that stage.

Setup Dependencies Between Render Passes:
Establish dependencies between render passes to ensure correct ordering of execution. A render pass may depend on the outputs (attachments) of one or more previous render passes.

Create a Framebuffer:
Create a framebuffer object that represents the render targets (attachments) for each render pass. The output of one render pass will typically serve as the input for the next render pass.

Execute Render Passes:
Traverse the render passes in the desired order, and for each pass:
a. Begin the render pass, specifying the framebuffer, clear operations, and load/store operations.
b. Bind the necessary resources (e.g., textures, buffers, shaders).
c. Issue rendering commands and draw calls specific to that render pass.
d. End the render pass.

Present the Final Image:
Once all render passes are executed, present the final image to the screen or further process it for post-processing or display.

Optimize for Parallelism and Efficiency:
Take advantage of parallelism and optimizations where possible to improve performance. For example, multiple render passes might be executed concurrently on different parts of the image or using GPU parallelism.


GEOMETRY PASS

In a typical rendering pipeline, the geometry render pass is responsible for processing geometry and preparing it for further rendering stages. The inputs and outputs of the geometry render pass can vary based on the specific rendering approach and the requirements of the application. However, here's a common representation of inputs and outputs for a geometry render pass:

Inputs:

    Vertex Buffers:
        Input vertices and attributes that define the geometry of 3D objects (e.g., positions, normals, texture coordinates).
        These are usually stored in GPU buffers (vertex buffers).

    Index Buffers (optional):
        Index data (if using indexed rendering) that defines the connectivity of vertices, reducing redundant vertex data.
        These are typically stored in GPU buffers (index buffers).

    Uniforms and Constants:
        Parameters that affect the transformation and rendering of geometry, such as model-view-projection matrices, material properties, lighting parameters, etc.

Outputs:

    G-Buffer:
    A set of textures (color and depth buffers) used for subsequent rendering passes (e.g., lighting pass).
    G-Buffer components typically include:
        Position Buffer: Stores the world-space positions of fragments.
        Normal Buffer: Stores surface normals for lighting calculations.
        Albedo (Color) Buffer: Stores the surface color of fragments.
        Material Properties Buffer: Stores material properties like roughness, metallicness, etc.

    Depth Buffer:
        A texture that stores depth information for use in depth testing and other rendering stages.

    Depth Pre-Pass Output (optional):
        If a depth pre-pass is used for optimizing the rendering pipeline, the depth pre-pass output can be an output of the geometry render pass.
        It contains the depth information for the scene.
    
    Other Buffers (optional):
        Additional intermediate buffers or outputs that might be required based on specific rendering techniques or optimizations.

The geometry render pass is a crucial stage where vertex and geometry data are processed, transformed, and organized for subsequent rendering stages, such as shading, lighting, and post-processing. The G-Buffer and depth buffer are essential outputs, providing detailed geometric and material information needed for accurate lighting computations in later passes. The specifics of inputs and outputs may vary based on the rendering pipeline and the requirements of the application.
